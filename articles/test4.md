# KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

“An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so complex, he can't understand it he's going to think you're a God because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius” ~ Terry Davis, Creator of Temple OS

A quote from rateher controversial figure but there is a lot of truth to it.
